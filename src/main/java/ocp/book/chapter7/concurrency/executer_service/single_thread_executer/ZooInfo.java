     * If a new task is submitted to the thread executor while it is shutting down, a RejectedExecutionException

     * What if you want to cancel all running and upcoming tasks? The ExecutorService provides a method called
     * shutdownNow(), which attempts to stop all running tasks and discards any that have not been started yet.
     * It is possible to create a thread that will never terminate, so any attempt to interrupt it may be ignored.
     * Lastly, shutdownNow() returns a List<Runnable> of tasks that were submitted to the thread executor but that
     * were never started.
